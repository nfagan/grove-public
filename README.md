# grove

This is the public repository for grove, a sandbox video game about sound, the environment, and interactive dynamic systems.

This document is intended as a resource for people looking to build and run the program from source, and / or for developers interested in modifying or extending the program. For a non-technical introduction to this work, see the accompanying website: [https://grove.ooo](https://grove.ooo).

# build

The simplest way to build and run this program -- and what I would recommend to most people -- follows. A more complete and technical build-guide is also available [here](todo).

## macos

* Press command + space to open spotlight search; search for `terminal.app` and press enter to open a terminal window.
* Type `git --version` and enter. This checks to see if git is installed. If it is, a version string will be printed (e.g. git version 2.32.0). Otherwise, you will be prompted to install developer tools from Apple; click accept/ok to install these tools.
* [Download and install](https://code.visualstudio.com) Visual Studio Code if you do not already have it.

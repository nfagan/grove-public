# grove

This is the public repository for grove, a sandbox video game about sound, the environment, and interactive dynamic systems.

This document is intended as a resource for people looking to build and run the program from source, and / or for developers interested in modifying or extending the program. For a non-technical introduction to this work, see the accompanying website: [https://grove.ooo](https://grove.ooo).

# build

The simplest way to build and run this program -- and what I would recommend to most people -- follows. A more complete and technical build-guide is also available [here](todo).
